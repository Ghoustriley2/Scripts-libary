# __RB LIBARY__
**a place where dreams really come true...**

a place where you will find a bunch of scripts for your roblox loader (executor) and your dreams will come true... activating each script you will be happy with each function...

# What is on this project?
**lots of interesting things...**

scripts, LUA-scripts for lua executor format, GUI scripts, and many other things for our roblox, as well as for trolling and any other actions.

# How much does it cost to use scripts? 
**in fact it's FREE! (because everyone knows that)...**

# are the scripts scam? are they not real? are you deceiving us???
**of course not! now i will explain why the scripts are not deceptive and what scripts need to be launched? and where they need to be launched.**

scripts contain information from GitHub where on a certain repository there is data published there... and the script is RAW link that is used in the template for loading in the executor.

here are the parts of the code that make up the application of each script -

```loadstring(game:Httpget('RAW LINK'))()```

***this is the composition of each script... we check RAW links to make sure whether the source is valid or not? and then we test these scripts in the game.***

> our project - your choice...
